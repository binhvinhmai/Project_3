        MASTER TO DO LIST:
        Each person needs to download the SQL statements in order for their project to work. 
        Part 1:
        Log in to where the user can validate password - and each password needs to be scrubbed
        Use MD5 System
        Start a new session when user logs in 
        When user logs out, session should be destroyed and inacccessible
        Part 2:
        Find a car
            Allows searching
            The user can type in ANYTHING about the car they're looking for (car model, make, color, size, or year)
            Cars that are found have status "1" can be shown (available), while cars with status "2" means it's currently rented, can't be searched
        When the user clicks "Rent Car" the car will be rented. 
            Creates a rental record
            Rent date - > current system date
            Update status from "1" to "2"
            Refreshes the rented cars - the list of the cars that the user has rented
        Rented cars
            Shows the car the user has rented
            When the user hovers a car, the "Return Car" button shows up
            When clicked, the car gets returned - change status from "2" to "1"
            Return date -> current system date
            Car no longer in rental history, show up in the rental history (AJAX)
            Now should be available for rental 
            Now appears in rental history
        Rental History
            Shows the car that have been returned
            Gets refreshed when user returns a car
